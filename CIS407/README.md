# school-code
This repository will contain all of the code for the classes I am taking in school. These mostly going to be textbook exercises, and are only here so can quickly and easily get them from anywhere.

## This code should not be used to indicate proficiency in any specific language or framework.
I will often use stupid, hacky solutions to problems. Thee are desigend to run once to fulfill homework requirements, and that is it. Don't judge me. :D
